# My Next.js AI-Powered Web Application

This project is a Next.js application generated by the Web Builder Agent. It is designed to **[Please add a brief description of your project's purpose here]**. The application leverages powerful AI models from OpenAI and Google Gemini, along with real-time search capabilities from Serper, to deliver its core functionality.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or later) and npm installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

2.  Install the required npm dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command installs all the necessary packages, including Next.js, React, and React DOM, as defined in the `package.json` file.

## Environment Variables

This project requires several environment variables to connect to external AI and search services. The recommended way to manage these is by creating a `.env.local` file in the root of your project. This file is ignored by Git, so your secret keys will not be committed to your repository.

1.  Create a file named `.env.local` in the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    ```

2.  Add the following variables to your `.env.local` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual API keys and model preferences:

    ```plaintext
    # .env.local

    # OpenAI API Key (Required for using models like GPT-4)
    # Get yours from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"

    # Google Gemini API Key (Required for using Gemini models)
    # Get yours from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"

    # Serper API Key (Required for Google Search integration)
    # Get yours from: https://serper.dev/
    SERPER_API_KEY="your_serper_api_key_here"

    # --- Optional: Specify Models ---
    # If not set, the application may use default models.
    # Example OpenAI Model: gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo
    OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4-turbo"

    # Example Gemini Model: gemini-1.5-pro-latest, gemini-1.0-pro
    GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-1.5-pro-latest"
    ```

#### Alternative: Shell Commands

Alternatively, you can export these variables directly in your terminal session. Note that these will only be available for the current session.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
export SERPER_API_KEY="your_serper_api_key_here"
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4-turbo"
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-1.5-pro-latest"
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following standard Next.js scripts:

### `npm run dev`

Starts the application in development mode with hot-reloading.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Builds the application for production usage. The optimized and minified build is created in the `.next` folder. This is a necessary step before you can run the production server.

### `npm run start`

Starts a production server for the built application. You must run `npm run build` successfully before this command will work. This command runs the optimized version of your site.

## Quick Usage Example

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running:

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add your API keys as described in the "Environment Variables" section above.

3.  **Start the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **View Your Application**
    Once the server starts, you will see a message like `âœ“ Ready in 5.2s`. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
